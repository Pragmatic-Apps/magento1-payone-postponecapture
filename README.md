# Magento (v1): Payone Postponed Online Capture (for Payolution Payments)
This extension extends the [Payone Payment extension](https://github.com/PAYONE-GmbH/magento-1) with an postponed capture functionality. This is necessary as some payment provides (e.g. Payolution Debit) just reserve a payment and require to actually capture the amount only **after shipment**.
The extension listens to the *shipment_saved_after* event and then checks if a capture has to be set.
